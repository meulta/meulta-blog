Here we are !

A few weeks after the last release we are excited to ship Vorlon.js 0.3 to the world. ðŸ™‚

In this version we focused to makeÂ node.js inspection better with Vorlon.js. Special thanks to [Sofiene Djebali](https://twitter.com/totose_)Â who is doing an awesome contribution to Vorlon.js!

We already added a preview of this capability in the 0.2 version, you can read more about it here : <http://meulta.com/en/2016/02/01/vorlon-js-0-2-1-is-out/>

&nbsp;

**Why would I want to use Vorlon.js to inspect my node.js app ?**

The idea behind this is to make you capableÂ ofÂ getting all the information you need to debug a node.js app remotely.

We all know Tools to debug locally and we alsoÂ know some of them that work remotely. What we are aiming isÂ to create anÂ easy-to-use set of Tools specialized on various node.js modules:

  1. In version 0.2 we added the possibilty toÂ inspect a node.js app with Vorlon.js. To do this you only have to **npm install**Â and **require** the vorlonjs-node-wrapper npm module. Then you can start the client part of Vorlon.js Inside your node app as documented here : http://vorlonjs.io/documentation/#debugging-nodejs-applications. Thanks to this, you can use Vorlon.js plugins
  2. Still in version 0.2 we made the standardÂ **Interactive Console**, **Object Explorer** and **XHR** plugins working in node.js inspection scenarios
  3. In version 0.3 we are bringing you 2 new plugins specifically crafted for node.js debugging 
      1. Node.js
      2. Express.js

We plan to add more of these specialized plugin to help you going through your worst debugging cases! ðŸ™‚

To activate these, you just have to go in the settings from the Vorlon.js Dashboard page.

</div>

**The Node.js plugin**

This one is the main that you want to use in a remote node debug scenario. As the Console, XHR and Object Explorer one it can be use for any node.js apps.

It is composed of 3 panes:

  * One displaying the hierarchy of modules you required inside your app
  * One showing a graph of your appÂ memory usage
  * One giving you information about the node process

<div style="width: 640px;" class="wp-video">
  <video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-197-2" width="640" height="384" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="http://meulta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nodejsdebugging.mp4?_=2" /><a href="http://meulta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nodejsdebugging.mp4">http://meulta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nodejsdebugging.mp4</a></video>
</div>

&nbsp;

**The Express.js plugin**

To be able to use this plugin, you obviously have to use Express.js in your node app. You also have to declare a variable so that Vorlon.js is able to access the Express informations:

_EXPRESS_VORLONJS = app;_

Once this is done, you will have access to :

  * The list of routes configured in your express app
  * The requests that has been made and that hit your routes
  * Your session variables
  * And the express local configuration

<div style="width: 640px;" class="wp-video">
  <video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-197-3" width="640" height="384" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="http://meulta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/expressjsdebug.mp4?_=3" /><a href="http://meulta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/expressjsdebug.mp4">http://meulta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/expressjsdebug.mp4</a></video>
</div>

**Next steps**

We are now going to start a huge refactoring process to be sure that the server part catches up with our plugin ambitions. We have a lot of great stuff in our roadmap. We will share this soon, stay tuned ! ðŸ™‚
